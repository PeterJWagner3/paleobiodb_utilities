Although the precise age of the Anzaldo Formation remains unclear, a late Darriwillian to early Sandbian age is accepted on the basis of its palynomorph content (Gagnier et al., 1986; Suárez Soruco, 2000; Davies et al., 2007) as well as its correlation with conodont-dated stratigraphic units of Argentina bearing microremains of Sacabambaspis (Albanesi et al., 1995; Albanesi and Astini, 2002). Unpublished palynomorphs and chitinozoans from the beds yielding the brachiopods described in this paper include Villosacapsula setosapellicula (Loeblich), Rhabdochitina cf. magna Eisenack, Ancyrochitina cf. ancyrea Eisenack and Desmochitina minor cocca Eisenack suggesting a Katian age (Pérez-Leyton, 1996).\r\n\r\nOverall consensus: this is basal Katian.
